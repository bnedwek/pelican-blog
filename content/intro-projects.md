Here's a little rundown of some ongoing projects I've been working on:

## Sun IPX

I have a lot of interest Unix and non-x86 architectures so I've always been drawn to old workstations. As I've become more aware of the role Sun Microsystems played in defining the standard network stack we still use today I developed an interest in owning a SPARC machine.

See more about this project [here]({tag}/sunipx).

## Quadro 700

I remember playing on my dad's 68k Mac when I was a little kid but I didn't have any conscious nostalgia for particular aspects of the Mac SYstem 7 era.

To get running on this Mac:

- A/UX
- A MIDI sequencer (Performer?)

## Mac Mini Server cluster

This project began when I found several identical 2012 Mac Mini servers on eBay. These are the original taller cases with the white acrylic tops, but they were sold with no optical drive (and no slot in the front). Instead they have two 500GB hard drives.

Things I want to get running on this cluster:

- Hadoop / HDFS / YARN
- Apache Spark
- Dask

Currently the head node for this cluster is a Raspberry Pi 3B+, configured as a dnsmasq server to bridge WiFi to a wired subnetwork for the Minis.
